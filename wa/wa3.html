        Ice cream is a frozen dessert typically made from milk or cream that has been flavoured with a sweetener, either sugar or an alternative, and a spice, such as cocoa or vanilla, or with fruit, such as strawberries or peaches. Food colouring is sometimes added in addition to stabilizers. The mixture is cooled below the freezing point of water and stirred to incorporate air spaces and prevent detectable ice crystals from forming. It can also be made by whisking a flavoured cream base and liquid nitrogen together. The result is a smooth, semi-solid foam that is solid at very low temperatures (below 2 °C or 35 °F). It becomes more malleable as its temperature increases.

        Ice cream may be served in dishes, eaten with a spoon, or licked from edible wafer ice cream cones held by the hands as finger food. Ice cream may be served with other desserts—such as cake or pie—or used as an ingredient in cold dishes—like ice cream floats, sundaes, milkshakes, and ice cream cakes—or in baked items such as Baked Alaska.

    <h4 id="History">History</h4>
    <p>
        There are several myths about the origin of ice cream. Some say Marco Polo brought it back from his travels to the Far East. Others say that Catherine de Medici introduced it to France when she relocated to marry King Henry II. Neither tale is likely to be true, though both are romantic. In fact, ice cream has a much more ancient history. Its earliest form holds very little resemblance to the ice cream we eat today. Biblical passages refer to King Solomon enjoying cooling iced drinks during harvest season. Alexander the Great of ancient Greece loved to indulge in icy drinks flavored with honey or wine. During Nero's reign of Rome from 54 to 68 BC, ice was harvested from nearby mountains and held in ice houses deep pits covered with straw. This practice of keeping ice in lieu of refrigeration would be common for centuries to come.
    </p>

        The emperors of the Tang Dynasty (618 to 907 AD) are believed to have been the first to eat a frozen milk-like confection. This version was made with cow, goat or buffalo milk that was heated with flour. Camphor, an aromatic substance harvested from evergreen trees, was added to enhance the texture and flavor. The mixture was then placed into metal tubes and lowered into an ice pool until frozen. This process is similar to the way Indians made kulfi prior to refrigeration.

    <p>
        Before the development of modern refrigeration, ice cream was a luxury reserved for special occasions. Making it was quite laborious; ice was cut from lakes and ponds during the winter and stored in holes in the ground, or in wood-frame or brick ice houses, insulated by straw. Many farmers and plantation owners, including U.S. Presidents George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, cut and stored ice in the winter for use in the summer. Frederic Tudor of Boston turned ice harvesting and shipping into a big business, cutting ice in New England and shipping it around the world.

    <h4 id="Vanilla Bean"><u>Vanilla Bean</u></h4>
    <img src="../img/vanilla.webp" alt="vanilla ice cream" width="375" height="281.5">
    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
        <p>2 ¼ cups milk</p>
        <p>1 cup heavy whipping cream</p>
        <p>¾ cup white sugar</p>
        <p>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</p>
    <h4>Directions:</h4>
        <p>Step 1: Stir milk, cream, and sugar in a saucepan over low heat until sugar has dissolved. Heat just until the mixture is hot and a small ring of foam appears around the edge.</p>
        <p>Step 2: Transfer cream mixture to a pourable container such as a large measuring cup. Stir in vanilla extract and chill mix thoroughly, at least 2 hours. (Overnight is best.)</p>
        <p>Step 3: Pour cold ice cream mix into an ice cream maker, turn on the machine, and churn according to manufacturer's directions, 20 to 25 minutes.</p>
        <p>Step 4: When ice cream is softly frozen, serve immediately or place a piece of plastic wrap directly on the ice cream and place in the freezer to ripen, 2 to 3 hours.</p>
    <h4 id="Chocolate"><u>Chocolate</u></h4>
    <img src="../img/chocolate.webp" alt="chocolate ice cream" width="375" height="281.5">
    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
        <p>1 cup milk</p>
        <p>¾ cup sugar</p>
        <p>2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder</p>
        <p>¼ teaspoon salt</p>

        <p>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</p>
    <h4>Directions:</h4>
        <p>Step 1: Combine milk, sugar, cocoa powder, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a simmer, stirring constantly.</p>
        <p>Step 2: Place egg yolks into a small bowl. Gradually whisk in about 1/2 cup of hot milk mixture, then return to the saucepan. Heat and stir until thickened, but do not boil.</p>
        <p>Step 3: Remove from the heat and stir in chopped chocolate until melted.</p>
        <p>Step 4: Pour into a chilled bowl and refrigerate, stirring occasionally, until cold, about 2 hours.</p>
        <p>Step 5: Stir in cream and vanilla. Pour into an ice cream maker and freeze according to manufacturer's directions.</p>

    <h4 id="Frozen-Bowl">Frozen-Bowl Ice Cream Makers</h4>
        <p>Most models intended for at-home use (including many in this review) are going to require you to first freeze the bowl and/or insert that the ice cream is to be churned in. This means a couple of things: First, it requires the forethought to place the bowl in the freezer, which is why we recommend storing the bowl in the freezer so you can make ice cream at a moment's notice. This also means, for most models, the machines are only able to make one batch at a time, as they require freezing after each use (purchasing an extra freezer bowl can remedy this). These models tend to be more affordable than compressor models (see below), making them the best choice for the average household that likes to make ice cream on occasion.</p>
    <h4 id="Compressor">Compressor Ice Cream Makers</h4>
        <p>These are the workhorses of the ice cream maker world, and an excellent choice for the at-home user who regularly makes homemade ice cream and the professional alike. No chilling here — compressors use built-in refrigeration so you can churn ice cream at any time with the push of a button. These tend to come with more advanced settings such as timers or alerts to tell you when to add your mix-ins. Price is the major consideration here, with standard models ranging anywhere from $200 to $500.</p>
    <h4 id="Salt">Salt and Ice Machines</h4>
        <p>Remember that elementary school science experiment where you made ice cream using just rock salt and ice in a plastic bag? If so, using a salt and ice machine will be a nostalgic experience. Some are hand-crank style, meaning they require you to manually turn the paddle to churn the ice cream (get ready for some sore arms), while others are a play on this blast-from-the-past ice cream churning experience, but with the modern day convenience of an electric motor. To use salt and ice machines, you'll need to pour your ingredients in the aluminum canister, pack in salt and ice around the canister, and churn either by hand or using an electric motor. Though not the most convenient model, salt and ice machines can be a fun way to get the kids involved in the process (more so than just pushing a button). Plus, they're said to produce an extremely creamy result. And, provided you have enough ice and salt on hand, you can use them to make back-to-back batches. For the regular ice cream maker, this is not the most practical option. But it's a fun novelty item that can certainly keep the kids entertained during the summer months.</p>
